You only pay extra for parts or individual component overhauls, as needed. The best way to schedule a tuneup is to stop on by the shop. We can take a look at your bike, determine what parts might need to be replaced, and give you an estimate for how long it will take and how much it will cost. Single speed tuneups (including kids' bikes, bmx, fixed gear, etc) are only $40. Please note that in season (March through October), we may be scheduling out up to a week in advance.</p>          </td>
